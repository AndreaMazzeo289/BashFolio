            "abstract": "Image processing applications are today increasingly employed in safety- and mission-critical fields for perception tasks. It is therefore vital to analyse the reliability of the designed system before its deployment and, if necessary, to adopt specific hardening techniques. In this paper we propose a cross-layer reliability evaluation framework specifically meant for image processing applications accelerated onto SRAM-based FPGAs. The framework is based on two key concepts: i) an application-level error simulation based on validated error models to speedup execution times, and ii) an analysis of the usability of the output images based on the working scenario. Such usability analysis allows the designer to study whether the downstream system would be able to take correct decisions even if the image processing outputs are corrupted. We applied the proposed idea on a motion detection application and we compared the achieved accuracy and the required execution times with the ones of a circuit-level fault injector, here considered as a ground truth. This experiment highlighted an accuracy comparable with the one of the fault injection with a dramatic time saving.",

            "published": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing ( Volume: 10, Issue: 2, 01 April-June 2022)",
            "abstract": "Image processing applications exhibit an intrinsic degree of fault tolerance due to i) the redundant nature of images, and ii) the possible ability of the consumers of the application output to effectively carry out their task even when it is slightly corrupted. In this application scenario the classical Duplication with Comparison (DWC) scheme, that rejects images (and requires re-executions) when the two replicasâ€™ outputs differ in a per-pixel comparison, may be over-conservative. In this article, we propose a novel lightweight fault tolerant scheme specifically tailored for image processing applications. The proposed scheme enhances the state-of-the-art by: i) improving the DWC scheme by replacing one of the two exact replicas with an approximated counterpart, and ii) allowing to distinguish between usable and unusable images instead of corrupted and uncorrupted ones by means of a Convolutional Neural Network-based checker. To tune the proposed scheme we introduce a specific design methodology that optimizes both execution time and fault detection capability of the hardened system. We report the results of the application of the proposed approach on two case studies; our proposal achieves an average execution time reduction larger than 30% w.r.t. the DWC with re-execution, and less than 4% misclassified unusable images.",

In these scenarios it is vital to carefully analyse the reliability of the designed system before deployment and, if necessary, to adopt specific hardening techniques. Two are the techniques generally employed: circuit-level fault injection and application-level functional error simulation. In this paper we present a set of functional error models specific for a number of convolution-based filters that are the basic building blocks for a wide range of image processing applications. The presented error models, derived through a number of circuit-level fault injection experiments, may be integrated into application-level functional error simulators, bridging the gap between the two strategies. The presented error models are the first step towards combining the accuracy of fault injection and the flexibility of error simulation into a widely adopted reliability analysis tool.",
